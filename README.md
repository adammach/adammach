ðŸ‘‹ Hi, this is simple project to save locally info about github repos. Many things is missing but ... who cares ;)

Run with command:
flutter run


<!---
adammach/adammach is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
